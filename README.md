# Bearing-Fault-Detection-using-Machine-Learning
This repository contains the implementation for an Industrial Data Analytics mini-project focused on early fault detection in bearings using machine learning. The goal is to classify the health status of bearings (healthy or faulty) based on sensor data, enhancing equipment reliability and enabling predictive maintenance.
